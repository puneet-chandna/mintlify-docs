## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to build the CloudSim-HO-Research-V2 project from source.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21:** You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk21-downloads.html). To verify your installation, run `java -version`.
- **Apache Maven 3.9+:** You can download it from the [Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi). To verify your installation, run `mvn -version`.
- **Git:** You can download it from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To verify your installation, run `git --version`.

## Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/puneet-chandna/cloudsim-ho-research-V2.git
cd cloudsim-ho-research-V2
```

## Building the Project

### Standard Build

To perform a standard build, which includes compiling the code, running the tests, and packaging the project into a JAR file, run the following command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Skipping Tests

If you want to speed up the build process, you can skip the tests by using the `-DskipTests` flag:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### Building the Executable JAR

The project is configured to create an executable JAR file with all the dependencies included. This JAR file will be located in the `target` directory and will be named `cloudsim-ho-research-v2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If the build fails, please make sure you have the correct versions of Java and Maven installed. You can also try cleaning the project by running `mvn clean` and then building it again.

### Missing Dependencies

If you get an error about missing dependencies, please make sure you have a working internet connection and that you are not behind a firewall that is blocking access to the Maven central repository.
