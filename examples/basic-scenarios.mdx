description: How to run the built-in simulation scenarios.

The framework defines a set of standard scenarios based on scale:

- **Micro:** 10 VMs, 3 Hosts
- **Small:** 50 VMs, 10 Hosts
- **Medium:** 100 VMs, 20 Hosts
- **Large:** (Disabled by default for stability)
- **XLarge:** (Disabled by default for stability)

By default, the Micro, Small, and Medium scenarios are enabled.

## Running Scenarios

You can specify which scenarios to run in the `config.properties` file. The `scenarios.enabled` property accepts a comma-separated list of scenario names.

For example, to run only the Micro and Small scenarios, you would set the property as follows:

```properties
scenarios.enabled=Micro,Small
```
