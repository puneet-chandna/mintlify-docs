title: CloudSim Plus
description: The simulation framework used in this project.
---

This project is built on top of CloudSim Plus, a modern, full-featured, and comprehensive framework for modeling and simulating cloud computing environments. CloudSim Plus provides the core functionalities for creating datacenters, hosts, and virtual machines, as well as for managing resource allocation and scheduling policies.

Our framework extends CloudSim Plus to implement the Hippopotamus Optimization algorithm for VM placement and to conduct detailed performance analysis. By leveraging the power and flexibility of CloudSim Plus, we can focus on the research aspects of our work without having to reinvent the wheel for the underlying cloud simulation infrastructure.
