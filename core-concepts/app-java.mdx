# App.java

The `App.java` class serves as the main entry point for the entire research framework. Its primary function is to initialize and orchestrate the complete experimental suite.

## Step-by-step Breakdown

1.  **Initializes Framework Components:** It sets up essential components like the `RunManager` for managing experiment directories and the `CSVResultsWriter` for saving results.
2.  **Creates an Experiment Coordinator:** It instantiates the `ExperimentCoordinator`, which is responsible for managing the overall workflow of the experiments.
3.  **Configures and Runs Experiments:** It calls the `configureExperiments()` and `runCompleteExperiment()` methods on the coordinator to execute the full suite of simulations as defined in the configuration files.
4.  **Handles Errors:** It includes top-level error handling to catch any critical exceptions that might occur during the execution of the experiments.

In short, `App.java` is the "master controller" that kicks off the entire simulation and analysis process.
