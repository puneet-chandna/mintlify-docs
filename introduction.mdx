# Introduction

Welcome to the CloudSim HO Research V2 project! ðŸ”±

This research framework is a specialized simulation environment built on CloudSim Plus to analyze and evaluate the performance of the Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm for Virtual Machine (VM) placement in cloud data centers.

The project is designed for research-grade experiments, offering a robust platform for comparing the HO algorithm against baseline allocation strategies like FirstFit, BestFit, and Genetic Algorithm (GA). This documentation is intended for researchers and students in the field of cloud computing and optimization algorithms who want to use or extend this framework.

## Key Objectives

**Primary Objective:** To provide a comprehensive implementation of the Hippopotamus Optimization algorithm for VM placement.

**Secondary Objective:** To statistically validate and compare the performance of the HO algorithm against other baseline algorithms.

**Tertiary Objective:** To conduct in-depth parameter sensitivity analysis and scalability testing to understand the algorithm's behavior under various conditions.

## Core Metrics for Evaluation

The framework is designed to measure and analyze the following key performance indicators:

- **Resource Utilization:** CPU and RAM usage efficiency.
- **SLA Violations:** The number of times the service level agreement is breached.
- **Power Consumption:** The energy efficiency of the data center.
- **Convergence:** The speed and stability of the optimization algorithm.
