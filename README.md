A research framework for evaluating the Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm for Virtual Machine (VM) placement in cloud data centers.

## Key Features

- A comprehensive implementation of the Hippopotamus Optimization (HO) algorithm.
- A robust platform for comparing the HO algorithm against baseline allocation strategies like FirstFit, BestFit, and Genetic Algorithm (GA).
- In-depth parameter sensitivity analysis and scalability testing.
- Detailed performance metrics, including resource utilization, SLA violations, and power consumption.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
