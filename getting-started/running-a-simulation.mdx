You can run the complete experimental suite using the `run-experiment.ps1` for windows and `run-experiment.sh` for linux. or use the `run-simulation.ps1` and `run-simulation.sh` for windows and linux respectively.

## Running the Experiment

To run the full experiment, use the following commands:

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
./run-experiment.ps1
```

**Bash:**
```bash
./run-experiment.sh
```



## Running the Simulation from JAR

To run the simulation from the JAR file, use the `run-simulation` scripts. Make sure the JAR file name in the script matches the one in your `target` directory.

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
./run-simulation.ps1
```

**Bash:**
```bash
./run-simulation.sh
```

The correct JAR file name is `cloudsim-ho-research-v2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
