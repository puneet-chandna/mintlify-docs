description: The main configuration file for the project.

This file controls the overall experimental setup. The properties are organized into logical groups.

### Experiment Settings

These properties control the overall behavior of the experiment.

- `experiment.replications`: Number of times to repeat each experiment for statistical significance.
- `experiment.confidence.level`: Confidence level for statistical analysis (e.g., 0.95 for 95%).
- `experiment.significance.level`: Significance level for statistical tests.
- `experiment.random.seed`: A seed for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility.

### Memory Management

These settings control how the framework manages memory, which is crucial for large-scale simulations.

- `memory.max.heap.gb`: Maximum heap size for the JVM.
- `memory.batch.processing.enabled`: Enables processing VMs in batches to conserve memory.

### Scenario Definitions

These properties define the scale of the simulation scenarios.

- `scenarios.enabled`: A comma-separated list of scenarios to run (e.g., `Micro,Small,Medium`).
- `scenario.*.vms`: The number of Virtual Machines for a given scenario (e.g., `scenario.micro.vms`).
- `scenario.*.hosts`: The number of hosts for a given scenario (e.g., `scenario.micro.hosts`).

> **Note:** The `Large` and `XLarge` scenarios are disabled by default for stability but can be enabled by uncommenting them and adding them to the `scenarios.enabled` list.

### Output Configuration

These settings control how the simulation results are saved.

- `output.base.directory`: The directory where the results will be saved.
- `output.csv.delimiter`: The delimiter to use for CSV files.

### Host and VM Configuration

These properties define the characteristics of the simulated hardware.

- `host.*`: Defines the properties of the host machines (e.g., `host.mips`, `host.ram`).
- `vm.*`: Defines the properties of the virtual machines (e.g., `vm.mips.min`, `vm.ram.max`).
